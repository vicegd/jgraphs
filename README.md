# JGraphs: A Toolset to Work with Monte-Carlo Tree Search-Based Algorithms

JGraphs is a toolset to work with MCTS-based algorithms. JGraphs is an extensible framework that allows developers to create applications based on MCTS in an agile and simple way. It provides several utilities that facilitate analysis, debugging, visualization and interoperability between applications, while offering some default implementations as well as extension mechanisms to make it easier for developers to tailor the code to their specific needs. With JGraph, developers will be able to focus on solving MCTS-based problems, which are already very complex, rather than reinventing the wheel repeatedly
